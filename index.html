        <!-- todo: fade here is wonky -->
        - What are you here for?
        - Emergent vs Engineered
          - Emergent:
            - Fostering Holochain's culture
            - Making connections & memories
            - Hatching schemes & honing philosophy
            - Goal Pursuit?
          - Engineered:
            - Goal Pursuit.
            - Program leads are taking point to achieve specific results
            - This whole team will be executing on a carefully laid plan. From time to time, we each may face crisp requirements.
            - We need active support and participation from students in that effort
        - A request: Be ready to support when we find ourselves in an “all hands on deck” moment
          - Our plan should minimize these moments, but they will certainly occur
        - Are we aligned?

        ## Course design

        - Alternating theory & practice
          - Weekday schedule
            - [Breakfast]
            - Morning Lecture
            - Try the Problem
            - [Lunch]
            - Afternoon Lecture
            - Exercises
            - [Activities & Dinner]
          - Evenings & Weekend
            - Roughly in 1/3rds: Salon conversations, Hackathons, Games
            - You're welcome to opt out, but Liz needs to know in advance so she can plan
        - Traveling as a pack
          - We move fastest together
          - No one on "the hunt" gets left behind unexpectedly
          - We can't move on without you
            - In lecture, Participants must understand every beat
            - Exercise completion is somewhat more flexible

        ## Lecture format

        - Very interactive & engaged
          - Format is conversational
          - Negotiated understanding
          - An ongoing conversation between the presenter and one Participant
        - The Presenter role
          - Will engage with Participants throughout
          - Presenter will shift the Counterpart role randomly among Participants throughout the conversation
        - The Counterpart role
          - In an active conversation with the Presenter
          - You'll be asked to step through a specific path of reasoning
            - Follow that narrative through to confirm it fully captures something
            - The hard part will be setting aside competing intuitions for where to focus

        ## Lecture format

        - The Participant role
          - Pretend you are in the Counterpart role
            - "Could I answer the question the Presenter just asked?"
              - If it turns out you couldn't have, raise your hand!
            - Take a note only when the Counterpart takes a note
          - Expected to understand the entire context and conversation
            - Expected to voice all confusion or uncertainty along the way
              - We can't succeed at the goal of getting you through the material otherwise
            - Raise hand immediately for totally new/unfamiliar words or concepts
            - For accumulated confusion, raise hand before we move on from the topic at the latest
          - Will be cold called into the Counterpart role
            - All questions by Presenter are directed at the current Counterpart
          - Should not self select to answer questions posed by the Presenter
            - The question that comes soonest in content order takes precedence!
          - Notetaking
            - Resist the urge to write something down before you fully understand it
      </section>

      <section class="align-top" language="markdown" animate="by-line with-ancestry unbalanced">
        ## Lecture format

        - The Observer role
          - May choose to attend or not attend a lecture
            - But should not enter or exit mid lecture
          - Not obligated to keep up with the conversation
          - Will not be cold called into the Counterpart role
          - Should limit questions to ones they're convinced they share with others in the Participant role
          - Take notes at your convenience
            - Best practices still apply, but since you will be suppressing certain questions, you may not be able to achieve "full understanding" prior to taking a note.
